          <strong>HOW TO PICK RIGHT SPOT FOR MY PLANT?</strong>

          <p>When choosing a good spot for your plant, the main things to keep in mind are:
<br>
<u>SPACE</u><br>
The most common mistake we see when people place plants is trying to squeeze them between things.<br>

Squeezing plants between or behind pieces of furniture is a sure way to block their air flow. This makes it difficult for your plant to breathe.

Good air flow, on the other hand, helps ensure a healthier, longer-living plant with stronger stems.<br>

With good airflow, your plant can achieve better temperature control and CO2 replenishment. Airflow also reduces humidity and lowers the occurrence of certain diseases.<br>

With that in mind, follow these guidelines:<br>

- Don’t try to squeeze your plants in a corner or behind furniture. Always make sure your plant has enough room to thrive.<br>
- Keep at least 6” of space in between your plants and any other furniture. <br>
- Place your plants in a spot with good air circulation, such as near hallways, in front of windows, and on top of tables. <br>
- For rooms with no windows and little air flow, choose a hardy plant (like the iron plant) that can survive in this type of environment. <br>
- It’s also a good idea to bring your plants out to a windowed room once in a while to give them a chance to refresh.<br><br>
<u>HUMIDITY</u><br>
Be aware that certain plants require more humidity than others.

Most indoor locations have low humidity due to heating and A/C units that dry out the air. For this reason, it’s best to keep your plants away from radiators and A/C units. If you desire a tropical plant (like Bird of Paradise, Cut-leaf Philodendron, Bella Palm or Rhapis Palm), you’ll need to mist them daily to ensure the proper moisture level.

If that sounds like too much work, then you are better off choosing a plant that requires less humidity.<br><br>
<u>TEMPERATURE</u><br>
Temperature is a very important factor in plant wellness. And when it comes to temperature, here is the main thing to keep in mind:

Air conditioning causes the soil to dry out more slowly.

Central or radiant heat causes the soil (and the plant itself) to dry out faster.

This is another reason why you should keep your plants away from radiators and A/C units.

It also explains why you need to water plants more often during the winter (when the heat is blasting inside) and less often during the summer (when the A/C is keeping your home cool).

          	Here are a few things to consider when determining plant size:<br>
            <ul>
			<li>Where will the plant go? Generally, floor plants should be taller while plants that sit on a table, desk, or window should be shorter.</li>
			<li>Keep in mind that your plant will grow. For this reason, it’s a good idea to buy a plant that is a little smaller than the one you 					ultimately want. (And if you live in a small apartment, you may not want a big, fast-growing plant.)</li>
			<li>Remember, bigger=heavier. Bigger plants are heavier, which makes them a little more difficult to move around. Small plants are easy to pick up and move whenever you desire.</li>
			<li>What kind of look do you want? Do you want your plant to be at eye-level or lower? Do you want an accent piece or a bold statement? The answers to these questions will have an impact on your plant size.</li>
			<li>Keep in mind the size of things around the plant. A small plant on top of a giant table might look silly, while a large plant might 					dwarf a tiny table next to it. Try to keep your plant in proportion to the rest of the room. </li>
          </ul>

          Plant care is something you should also think about before you buy your plant. This is because some plants require more care than others.<br> 
          <strong>WATERING YOUR PLANTS</strong><br>
          The most time-intensive part of plant care is watering your plants. It’s also the most common way that people kill their plants.
If you don’t water your plant often enough, it will dry out and die. But if you water your plant too much, it can also die! (Surprisingly, this is much more common than you think.). The best advice is to check the soil level before watering. How often you should water your plant depends on the type of plant you have. <br>
		  <strong>FERTILIZING YOUR PLANTS</strong><br>
          Everyone knows they need to water their plants, but many people overlook the importance of fertilizer. Plants will extract nutrients from the soil, and over time that soil will become depleted. Using fertilizer helps keep your soil nutrient-rich so your plants stay happy and healthy.<br>
          <strong>TRIMMING/CLIPPING YOUR PLANTS</strong><br>
          It’s important to regularly cut off dead leaves and trim back overgrown stems. This will help your plant to grow to its fullest potential and look fresh and healthy.<br>

          Jade prefer not to be misted. <br> Heat dries out the air the most, and misting pants that
          love humidity <strong>daily</strong> during the cold season is essential. AC will remove
          moisture from the air as well but not as much. Mist your humidity loving plants at least
          few times a week during the warm season. A humidifier is also a good option. Your skin
          and your plants will benefit from it equally :)

            <p>They are probably fungus gnats. They are not very harmful to plants but very annoying to us:) These guys can come
                 from anywhere - air vents, drain pipes, etc. They find nice warm and moist environment to lay their eggs in. Frequent
                  or excessive watering encourages their development. You can usually get rid of them by reducing the frequency of 
                  watering and allowing the soil to dry more between watering.</p>
